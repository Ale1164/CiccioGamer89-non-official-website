	  <p class="ciccio1">Mirko Alessandrini, better known as CiccioGamer89, is an Italian YouTuber born in Rome on January 27, 1989. He began his online career in 2012, focusing on gameplay videos and gradually expanding into cooking content and personal vlogs. His signature greeting “Hakuna matata, ragazzi!” and the hermit crab mascot became trademarks of his channel. Over the years, he gained significant popularity, reaching milestones like 100,000 subscribers in 2014 and one million in 2016. <br><br> In 2016, he was involved in a viral incident named “Nutellagate,” where he was hit with croissants during a fan event. He responded publicly, condemning hate-driven behaviour online. Battling obesity, Alessandrini underwent sleeve gastrectomy surgery in 2017 and documented his weight loss journey. He also published several books, including an autobiography, Fortnite guides, and cookbooks. <br><br> His culinary series “In cucina con Ciccio” led to the launch of delivery-only burger kitchens in major Italian cities, followed by the opening of his first physical restaurant in Rome in 2025. He collaborated with Durex Italia in 2022 to release themed condoms featuring his mascot. </p>

	  <p class="ciccio2">In late 2022, Alessandrini faced legal issues when the Guardia di Finanza accused him of tax evasion totalling €400,000, related to undeclared income exceeding €1 million. He denied wrongdoing and stated that his legal team was handling the matter. In 2023, he received backlash for comments made during a livestream that appeared to support a one-party state. He later clarified that his remarks were taken out of context and were meant to express a desire for political unity. <br> <br>
	  In 2024, he expanded into the trading card world by opening a card shop in Imperia and founding CiccioGamer TCG. The launch event drew large crowds, prompting local authorities to issue traffic regulations. His entrepreneurial ventures and continued online presencevb have solidified his role as a prominent figure in Italian digital entertainment.
